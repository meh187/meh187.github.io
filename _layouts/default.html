      <h3 class = "about">About me</h3>
      <p align="justify">I am a graduating senior at the University of Pittsburgh, where I major in physics (B.S. with honors, 2020) and minor in mathematics and economics. I conduct research in astronomy, and have experience in data analysis, scientific computing, and science communication. My background in physics, mathematics, and economics has provided me with strong problem-solving skills and quantitative tools that I am equipped to apply to any field or challenge. I am also dedicated to science outreach to improve access, education, and equality in science, and volunteer widely in Pittsburgh.</p>

      <h4 class = "varstars">Astronomy</h4>
      <p align="justify"><img src = "C:\Users\mheig\Documents\Research\Delta Scuti DTD\dtdcode\outputs\figures\lmcsadcells.png" align = "left">I study the evolution and lifetimes of variable stars, which are stars that are unstable to pulsations. They are uniquely useful for measuring astronomical distances, studying stellar interiors, and dating stars, and I am interested in how they evolve. I use both observational data and stellar models to conduct statistical analyses of these stars to determine their formation timescale (age) and lifetime (duration of variability).</p>

      <p align="justify"><a href = "https://www.phys.ksu.edu/reu/2018/heiger.html"><img src = "C:\Users\mheig\Documents\REU\REU Research\salt box protein.jpg" align = "right"></a>In the summer of 2018, I worked on a project in theoretical biophysics at Kansas State University. I studied the effect of mobile salt ions on the function of biological macromolecules like proteins. Macromolecular functions, like drug interactions, can be exquisitely sensitive to ion content. Modern molecular dynamics simulations do not account for the effects of mobile ions on molecules, fixing salt content in a small volume rather than allowing it to freely fluctuate. I constructed mathematical models to determine the size of these effects, for future implementation in simulations.</p>

      <p align="justify"><a href = "https://github.com/meh187/comp-methods-slingshot"><img src = "C:\Users\mheig\Downloads\website_vid.gif" align = "left"></a>Final project for an upper level course in computational physics focusing on the physics of gravitational slingshots, in which a satellite uses the gravitational energy of a planet to change course or speed.  Involved the calculation, scientific analysis, and animation of Keplerian orbits, gravitational assists by satellites, and the trajectory of Voyager 1.</p>
