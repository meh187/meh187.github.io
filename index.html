title: "Mairead Heiger"
description: "Astronomy. Data science. STEM education. Pittsburgh, PA."

about_me: "I am a graduating senior at the University of Pittsburgh, where I major in physics (B.S. with honors, 2020) and minor in mathematics and economics. I conduct research in astronomy, and have experience in data analysis, scientific computing, and science communication. My background in physics, mathematics, and economics has provided me with strong problem-solving skills and quantitative tools that I am equipped to apply to any field or challenge. I am also dedicated to science outreach to improve access, education, and equality in science, and volunteer widely in Pittsburgh."

var_stars_desc: "I study the evolution and lifetimes of variable stars, which are stars that are unstable to pulsations. They are uniquely useful for measuring astronomical distances, studying stellar interiors, and dating stars, and I am interested in how they evolve. I use both observational data and stellar models to conduct statistical analyses of these stars to determine their formation timescale (age) and lifetime (duration of variability)."

kansas_desc: "In the summer of 2018, I worked on a project in theoretical biophysics at Kansas State University. I studied the effect of mobile salt ions on the function of biological macromolecules like proteins. Macromolecular functions, like drug interactions, can be exquisitely sensitive to ion content. Modern molecular dynamics simulations do not account for the effects of mobile ions on molecules, fixing salt content in a small volume rather than allowing it to freely fluctuate. I constructed mathematical models to determine the size of these effects, for future implementation in simulations."

comp_methods_project: "Final project for an upper level course in computational physics focusing on slig. Calculation, scientific analysis, and animation of Keplerian orbits, gravitational assists by satellites, and Voyager 1 trajectory."

comp_methods_portfolio: "Final portfolio for an upper level course in computational physics. Topics covered include applications in physics and astronomy of numerical integration, curve-fitting, solutions of linear and nonlinear equations, Fourier transforms, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, and Monte Carlo methods."
